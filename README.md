# Molly's Casino Project
This project is incomplete.  I spent many hours trying to fix issues with the original deck structure before completely restarting the project... then  I started having issues with game logic where it wasn't printing the game information until the game was over or was having information with ignoring my "stay" response.  The game has been rolled back to a point where things have been tested.  One test does not pass(I got stuck on how to check for result from innerHTML print functions).
